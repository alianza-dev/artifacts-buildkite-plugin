# Artifacts Buildkite Plugin

A [Buildkite plugin](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/plugins) for uploading and downloading artifacts.

## Uploading artifacts

This functionality duplicates the [artifact_paths]() property in the pipeline yaml files.

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        upload: "log/**/*.log"
```

or

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        upload: [ "log/**/*.log", "debug/*.error" ]
```

or

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        upload: 
          from: log1.log
          to: log2.log
```

or

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        upload: 
        - from: log1.log
          to: log2.log
```

## Downloading artifacts

This downloads artifacts matching globs to the local filesystem. See [downloading artifacts](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/cli-artifact#downloading-artifacts) for more details.

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        download: "log/**/*.log"
```

or

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        download: [ "log/**/*.log", "debug/*.error" ]
```

or

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        download: 
          from: log1.log
          to: log2.log
```

or

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      artifacts#v1.2.0:
        download: 
        - from: log1.log
          to: log2.log
```

## Configuration

### `step` (optional)
